# Counter-Application


‚ú® Project Description: Vanilla JavaScript DOM CounterThis project is a fundamental web application built entirely with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, designed to demonstrate mastery of basic Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation and event handling.
üéØ Key Features and FunctionalityCore State Management: Utilizes a simple JavaScript variable (let count) to manage the application's state, demonstrating the separation of concerns between logic and presentation.Dynamic DOM Updates: Implements the updateDisplay() function, which is responsible for dynamically reading the current state (count) and updating the HTML element's text content, providing instant feedback to the user.1Event Handling: Uses vanilla JavaScript's addEventListener to bind click events to three distinct buttons:Increment: Increases the count by one ($+1$).Decrement: Decreases the count by one ($-1$), with a crucial safety check.Reset: Instantly sets the count back to zero ($0$).Input Guardrail (Non-Negative Constraint): A core requirement is met by ensuring the count never drops below zero. This is enforced by:An if (count > 0) check within the decrement logic.Dynamically disabling the "Decrement" button and applying a visual disabled class when the counter is at $0$, enhancing user experience and preventing invalid actions.Minimalistic Styling: A clean, modern, and minimalistic CSS design is applied to ensure high readability and a focused user interface, utilizing distinct color coding for different button actions (Increment/Success, Decrement/Danger, Reset/Warning).
